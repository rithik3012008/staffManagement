Users can:

📥 Add new staff members with details like name, age, city, email, phone, job post, and start date.

🖼️ Upload a profile picture for each staff member.

👀 View full staff profiles in a modal window.

📝 Edit or update any existing staff information.

🗑️ Delete staff profiles if no longer needed.

💾 All data is stored locally using LocalStorage, so it works even without a backend.

⚙️ Tech Stack:
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 4 & 5

Scripting: JavaScript (DOM manipulation & localStorage)

UI Framework: Bootstrap modal, tables, buttons for form handling and data display

🎯 Use Case:
Ideal for small companies, startups, or educational projects where you need a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) interface to manage staff or employee data without setting up a full backend or database.
